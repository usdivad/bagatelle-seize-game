An interactive song / music game for digital dreamers. This current prototype includes two contrasting sections, one on the right side of the playable area and another on the left.

Use WASD or arrow keys to move, space to jump. Explore how movement, location, and interaction with your mirrored counterpart affect musical parameters!

Made using the [Superpowers](http://superpowers-html5.com) HTML5 engine and extending the game engine's audio capabilities with Conductor and MultiSoundPlayer classes (available [here](https://github.com/usdivad/superpowers-game/tree/soundAdditions)).
